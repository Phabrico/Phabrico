== Embedding Mocks (Pholio)

You can embed a Pholio mock by using braces to refer to it:

{M123}

By default the first four images from the mock set are displayed. This behavior
can be overridden with the **image** option. With the **image** option you can
provide one or more image IDs to display.

You can set the image (or images) to display like this:

{M123, image=12345}
{M123, image=12345 & 6789}

== Embedding Pastes

You can embed a Paste using braces:

{P123}

You can adjust the embed height with the `lines` option:

{P123, lines=15}

You can highlight specific lines with the `highlight` option:

{P123, highlight=15}
{P123, highlight="23-25, 31"}
