= Linking to Objects =

You can link to Phabricator objects, such as Differential revisions, Diffusion
commits and Maniphest tasks, by mentioning the name of an object:

D123          # Link to Differential revision D123
rX123         # Link to SVN commit 123 from the "X" repository
rXaf3192cd5   # Link to Git commit "af3192cd5..." from the "X" repository.
# You must specify at least 7 characters of the hash.
T123          # Link to Maniphest task T123

You can also link directly to a comment in Maniphest and Differential (these
can be found on the date stamp of any transaction/comment):

T123#412       # Link to comment id #412 of task T123

See the Phabricator configuration setting `remarkup.ignored-object-names` to
modify this behavior.

= Embedding Objects

You can also generate full-name references to some objects by using braces:

{D123}        # Link to Differential revision D123 with the full name
{T123}        # Link to Maniphest task T123 with the full name

These references will also show when an object changes state (for instance, a
task or revision is closed). Some types of objects support rich embedding.

== Linking to Project Tags

Projects can be linked to with the use of a hashtag `#`. This works by default
using the name of the Project (lowercase, underscored). Additionally you
can set multiple additional hashtags by editing the Project details.
